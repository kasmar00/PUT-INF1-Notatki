\section{Personal disaster}
It is said that when there is a train problem it either doesn't impact you, or impacts you terribly. Last weekend, while comming back from Wrocław, I was impacted by a train delay. My train was deleyed due to a locomotive breakdown, by nearly two hours and counting. Lucky for me, I was issued a document by a Ticket Office, in which it was written that I can use a later train to get to Poznań. Unfortunatelly for me, seat reservation was not included in it, due to overbooking. As the train was pulled into station, it occured to me that some of the carriages were changed and included more seats, originaly excluded from reservation. One of which was taken by me. While the train arrived in Poznań, the originall train was deleyed three hours and counting.
